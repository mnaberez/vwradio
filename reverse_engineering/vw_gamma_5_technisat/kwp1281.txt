0x2B Login
    Login with SAFE code works like on the Premium 5.  Reading
    group 0x19 responds with NAK but it's a lie, treat it like ACK.

0x01 Read RAM (Protected)
    Returns the unencrypted contents of the M38869FFAHP's RAM.
    Only allows reading 0x0000-07FF but this is the entire RAM area.

0x03 Read ROM or EEPROM (Protected)
    Returns XOR encrypted contents of the M38869FFAHP microcontroller's
    flash ROM.  Only allows reading 0x2000-0xFEFF.  The entire ROM is
    0x2000-0xFFFF.  The missing 256 bytes are the XOR encryption key.

    The ROM has several unused 256-byte pages before the encryption
    key at 0xFF00.  These unused pages contain all 0xFF.  To recover
    the key, read 0xFE00-0xFEFF and XOR it with 0xFF.  Use the key to
    decrypt 0x2000-0xFEFF, then append the key to the end (0xFF00-0xFFFF)
    to complete the dump.

    Note: the M38869F'F'AHP has 60K flash ROM (0x1000-0xFFFF) but the
    first 4K (0x1000-0x1FFF) is not readable by this command.  This is
    not an issue because the firmware is only 56K.  The first 4K contains
    all 0xFF.  The firmware was probably designed to fit in the 'E'
    version of the MCU, which has 56K flash ROM.

0x19 Read EEPROM (Protected)
    Returns the unencrypted contents of the two 24C08 EEPROMs (1K each).
    Responds with title 0xEF (unlike Premium 4 and 5 which respond with 0xFD).
    Only allows reading 0x0000-0x07FF (2K).

    0x0000-0x03FF (first 1K)
        "Right side" 24C08 EEPROM (closest to the antenna)
        EEPROM addresses 0x009-0x00F are filtered out (zeroed).  The
        filtered range includes the SAFE code at 0x00C-0x00F.

    0x0400-0x07FF (second 1K)
        "Left side" 24C08 EEPROM
        Identical to the real EEPROM contents

Address 0x7C
------------

Radio does not send the usual 55 01 8A, instead it sends these
unknown 5 bytes:

10 01 5E 00 90
            ^^ looks like (sum of previous 4 bytes)^0xff

After addressing the radio once on 0x7C, it will not send the
sequence again unless it is power cycled or the volume knob
is pushed twice (once to turn off, once again to turn back on).
