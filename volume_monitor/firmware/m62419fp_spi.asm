;M62419FP Interrupt-Driven SPI Receiver
;
;The M62419FP uses a 14-bit SPI command.  Since 14 is not a multiple of 8, it
;can't be received by the hardware SPI.  This code uses bit-banging: a pin
;change interrupt fires for the clock edges and the ISR accumulates the bits.
;
;There are 3 buffers used in this code.  The ISR uses packet_isr_buf to
;accumulate SPI bits received.  When a complete packet is received, it moves
;the packet into packet_rx_buf.  The main loop waits for a new packet in
;packet_rx_buf and then transfers it into packet_work_buf.  The work buffer is
;used by all code in the main loop.  This allows receiving a new command while
;the main loop is still processing the last one.  The main loop should call
;spi_get_packet (below) and then operate only on packet_work_buf.
;
;Registers reserved for the ISR that may not be used by any other code:
;  R21, R22
