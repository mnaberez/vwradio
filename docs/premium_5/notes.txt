Single Disc CD Player
---------------------

The in-dash single disc CD player (1J0 035 119 A) will not function with the
Premium 5 radio unless the player is grounded separately (the radio will display
`NO CHANGER`).  The cable between the radio and the player is not enough.
Ground anywhere on the player's chassis to make it work.  There is a 2-pin
connector on the back of the player; this is presumably where the player
gets its ground from where installed in the car.

Interestingly, the player seems to work fine on the Premium 4 radio without
having to ground the chassis.  It's a good idea to ground it anyway.

CD Pause
--------

The radio doesn't expose a way to pause while playing a CD, but the player is
capable of pausing.  If you are playing a CD and switch to another mode like FM,
the CD will stop.  If you then switch back to CD, it will pick up where it left
off.  Connecting to the radio with KWP-1281 ("DIAG" mode) also pauses the CD
and resumes on disconnect.
